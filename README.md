# RESILIENCE STUDY
## Research on the predictive power of personal and contextual characteristics on a person's resilience capacity.

### Introduction
Recently, since the global pandemic of COVID-19 and the associated lock-down and disruption of social habits in 2020, there has been a growing interest in a concept already known and used in the field of psychology since the 1970s: resilience.

The concept of resilience is subject to different interpretations and therefore it is difficult to measure it precisely by means of a psychological scale, since a construct that is complete for some researchers will not be sufficient for others.

A different approach would be to measure resilience empirically through the impact of the context in which the person is living on their mental health: if there is an increase in symptoms related to stress, anxiety or depression, and there is also interference with their ability to function on a daily basis, we could conclude that the person is not being resilient.

This line of research is being addressed by a team led by Dr. Carmen Valiente and Dr. Carmelo VÃ¡zquez, from the Department of Clinical Psychology at the Complutense University of Madrid, when they joined an international Consortium formed by several European universities to study the effect on mental health of the COVID-19 pandemic. They designed a longitudinal study to measure the psychological changes occurring in the general adult Spanish population over the duration of the pandemic. This was done by means of an internet-based survey launched at two different times: T1, took place during the peak of the pandemic (April 7-14, 2020) in the middle of the confinement and T2, just before the relaxation measures of such confinement started (May 7-11, 2020), when daily deaths were already decreasing notably. In this way, it is possible to profile the sample at T1 and to know its state at T2, extracting one resilience value out of four possible ones ("Resilient", "Recovered", "Sustained distress", "Delayed distress") for each (participant) observation.

Their study investigated the role of sociodemographic, health, psychological, and interpersonal relationship variables in the above categories of resilience, finding through a multinomial logistic regression model that a higher probability of resilience was associated with being male, being older, having no history of mental health, and having high levels of identification with humanity and psychological well-being. In addition, low levels on other variables (anxiety and economic threat due to the pandemic, substance use during confinement, intolerance of uncertainty, death anxiety, loneliness, and distrust) were also predictors of a psychological resilience response to COVID-19.

### Goals

The overall goal of this TFM is to extend the study described above, using other machine learning techniques. Specifically, the objectives are:
- Analyze the factors with the highest predictive power and validate/extend the findings of the previous study.
- To create a predictive model of resilience for the general population dependent only on personal characteristics, i.e., independent of context.
- Develop an interactive application based on a simplification of the above model that can serve as a tool to test a person's level of resilience in the near future in the face of a difficult context.

In recent years there has been an increase in research on the use of machine learning methods in the field of psychology as a complement to diagnostic techniques and selection of possible therapeutic treatments. This work falls within this field of research and aims to provide new evidence on the aspects of diagnostic and treatment methodology that are likely to increase their effectiveness with the use of machine learning techniques.
